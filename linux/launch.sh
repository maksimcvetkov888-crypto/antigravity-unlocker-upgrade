# Runs as the normal user - NO sudo. The phase-2 region route is entirely
# unprivileged: the language server that carries the gate lives in
# ~/.local/share (user-writable), the local proxy is a systemd *user* unit, and
# AG_LS_PROXY is a user drop-in. That is also what makes "right-click > Run as a
# Program" work without a password prompt. A system-wide /opt install would need
# root to patch, but the per-user copy is the one the app actually runs.
#
# Since 2.12.2 the tool IS a window (eframe/egui) - there is no numbered menu any
# more. So this script no longer reopens itself inside a terminal emulator: that
# would put an empty black window behind the real one, and on a box with no
# terminal emulator installed the old fallback ("hope stdout is visible") left
# the user with nothing at all. What it does instead is check that there is a
# graphical session to draw into. With none, a terminal still gets the whole
# program as the terminal UI (the binary picks it by itself - `--tui` is only
# said here to be plain about it); with neither, it says so.

# Started as `sh launch.sh`: on Debian/Ubuntu sh is dash, which stops at the
# first bash-only line below. POSIX up to here, so dash can hand over.
