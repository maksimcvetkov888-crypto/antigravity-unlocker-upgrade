# Build caches.
#
# The release profile is the slow part - fat LTO over ~300 crates into a single
# codegen unit - and this script used to end every run with `cargo clean`, so
# every build started from nothing. The caches are kept now, and pruned so they
# cannot grow: whatever the next build can reuse stays, whatever it cannot goes.
#
# A release cache - target\release for Windows, LINUX_CACHE for the Linux build -
# is pruned right after a build that SUCCEEDED, down to exactly the units that
# build used. Liveness is read, not guessed: timestamps cannot say it, because cargo
# touches nothing it finds fresh. cargo's JSON messages can - they report every
# unit the build used, fresh or rebuilt, and name its files, which carry the same
# 16-hex unit hash as the unit's build/ and .fingerprint/ directories. That naming
# is cargo's internals rather than a promise, so it is checked on every run: if
# any unit the build just used has no .fingerprint directory under its hash,
# nothing is deleted. A cache that stops shrinking is a nuisance; one pruned wrong
# makes every next build cold again, which is the thing this exists to prevent.
# A failed or interrupted build prunes nothing - half a build proves nothing about
# what is dead.

# 26.04 (glibc 2.43), `_4`'s ELF picked up a GLIBC_2.39 version reference for two
# `pidfd_*` symbols out of Rust std's process-spawn fast path. The symbols
# themselves are weak and std falls back without them - but the `.gnu.version_r`
# entry is `Flags: none`, so ld.so refuses to start the file at all on anything
# older: `version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found`, before main. Nothing else in the binary
# asked for more than GLIBC_2.34.
#
# cargo-zigbuild pins the baseline at link time, so this needs no second distro.
# 2.17 is Rust std's own floor, and zig ships stubs for it: against them
# `__libc_start_main`, `dlsym` and the `pthread_*` family link to their pre-2.34
# homes in libpthread/libdl, so the 2.34 an earlier note called "the floor the
# code itself sets" was only where a *modern* glibc had moved those symbols.
# Measured 2026-09-19: a 2.17 build asks for nothing above GLIBC_2.17 and NEEDED
# holds libc, libm, libpthread, libdl - all glibc. Covers CentOS/RHEL 7, Ubuntu
# 14.04+, Debian 8+: the old servers the terminal mode is for, not only desktops.
