//! Reads the two facts no probe can measure - the region 400, and a model
//! answer - out of the language server's own log.
//!
//! `cloudcode-pa` refuses a blocked region with `FAILED_PRECONDITION (code 400):
//! User location is not supported for the API use`. That answer travels inside
//! the client's own TLS, and an unauthenticated probe never sees it -
//! `loadCodeAssist` answers 401 from a permitted and a blocked exit alike
//! (kb/dns.md). Every signal the tool has about a route's region is therefore
//! indirect: the exit's country, whether an address was substituted, whether a
//! tunnel carried bytes. The client's log is the only place the refusal is
//! written down in plain text, so the relay tails it.
//!
//! The other half is the one thing that proves the bypass works: a model answer
//! logs `…/v1internal:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse Trace: 0x… ResponseID: …`
//! when it starts streaming, and a refused turn logs no such line (measured on
//! the IDE log of 2026-09-12: refusals 14:58–15:00, first `ResponseID` 15:16).
//! Silence proves nothing - a user who gave up is silent too (G50) - so the
//! window says "работает" only on this line, and the route table ranks routes by
//! it (`routes`).
//!
//! Tailing, not reading: each pass looks at the lines appended since the last
//! one and nothing else, so an old refusal from a session hours ago cannot
//! trigger anything now. A file seen for the first time is taken from its end
//! for the same reason. A file that shrank was rotated or the app restarted, and
//! is read from the start - it is new content either way.
//!
//! Two readers, asking different questions of the same file. `poll` is the
//! relay's: "what came in since I last looked", which is what may be *acted*
//! on. `newest_refusal` is the window's: "is the user hitting the gate right
//! now", which has to be answerable about the minutes before this process
//! started - so it reads the log's own stamps rather than a saved offset. The
//! two share the pattern and the file list and nothing else; they run in
//! different processes and neither moves the other's position.
