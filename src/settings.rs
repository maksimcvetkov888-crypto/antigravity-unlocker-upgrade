//! What the user switched on, remembered between runs.
//!
//! The old build had no such file: state lived only in the system (an NRPT rule
//! either exists or does not) and the menu asked again every time. A switch UI
//! needs both — the *system* answers "is it on right now", this answers "is it
//! on because the user asked for it", which is what lets the app put a switch
//! back where the user left it and re-apply after a reboot wiped something.
//!
//! Deliberately best-effort: a missing or corrupt file is a fresh `Settings`,
//! never an error the user has to deal with.
//!
//! Lives in `dns_forwarder::log_dir()`, next to `upstream.txt`, and for the same
//! reason: the relay task runs **as this user** under an S4U principal, not as
//! SYSTEM, so per-user state is exactly what both processes can reach. It is
//! also why the provider deny-list needs no second copy anywhere — one file,
//! re-read rather than cached, is the pattern `upstream::configured` already
//! set (src/upstream.rs:286).
