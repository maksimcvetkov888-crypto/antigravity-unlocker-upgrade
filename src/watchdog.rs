// Keeping the patch alive across Antigravity's own auto-updates.
//
// The auto-updater silently replaces language_server.exe (and, on the IDE,
// main.js), which reverts the rename and the region gate comes back - the user
// hits the error again and has to re-run the unlocker by hand. This watcher,
// running inside the DNS relay (a byte copy of this build, so it already
// contains every patch routine), notices the replaced file and re-applies the
// patch in the background.
//
// The one firm rule: if the signature is GONE - a build new or broken enough
// that this patcher does not recognise it - do nothing. Leave the app exactly
// as the update left it, so it launches and shows its own error. That error is
// the signal for the user to fetch a newer unlocker; a half-applied guess would
// only hide it. `RepatchOutcome::SignatureMissing` is that case, and it is held
// distinct from a transient `Failed` (a file locked mid-update, worth a retry).
//
// Enforcement of "no unpatched server keeps running" needs no separate kill:
// `patch_binary::write_binary` already kills a process holding the binary open
// and retries, so a running-but-reverted Language Server is replaced in the
// same write - and the editor shell, which never holds that file, is untouched.
