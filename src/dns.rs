// `cloudcode-pa` is back (2026-08-30), and it is the one entry here whose
// history matters. It was dropped under N2 because a 22-resolver sweep found
// **nobody** substituting it (S9) - a rule for a name every provider answers
// genuinely is pure DNS leakage. That premise died the moment a provider that
// does substitute it was measured: dns-ai.ru answers with one of its own egress
// addresses, and that address accepts the SNI and replies as Google's own
// frontend. (The 2026-08-30 measurement named `186.246.45.126`; that egress has
// since been deleted and the address reassigned, so the number is not repeated
// here — see the note in `resolvers.rs` and G43.) N2 still holds
// as written - do not add a name *nobody* substitutes - but it was never a rule
// about this hostname, it was a rule about the measurement, and the measurement
// changed. `antigravity-unleash` stays out: still genuine everywhere.
//
// `daily-cloudcode-pa` stays because it is the same service by another name and
// two providers reach it. `generativelanguage` and `aistudio.google.com` are
// **deliberately absent** (owner, `_4`): both were only ever routed for the
// Gemini CLI flow, the IDE was measured running a full agentic task with the
// `generativelanguage` rule removed, and another of the owner's tools owns those
// two names now. We neither install them nor take them away - `remove_dns_nrpt`
// works off `all_tags()`, so it only ever removes rules carrying our own tag and
// a foreign rule on either name is left alone (so is a subtree rule, I44).
// Everything else Antigravity talks to - oauth2/www/play/accounts and
// jetski-webchannel - works on real Google and is deliberately not listed.
