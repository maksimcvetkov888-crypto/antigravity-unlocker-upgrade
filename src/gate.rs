//! What the bypass is doing about the region 400, written where the window can
//! read it — and the window's own live watch of the client's log.
//!
//! The watch that *acts* lives in the relay (`ls_log::poll` →
//! `dns_forwarder::answer_region_400`) and has to: that is the process holding
//! the route table, the resolver cache and the tunnel verdict. The window is a
//! different process, and until now its only view of any of it was
//! `forwarder.log` — a file written for a person to read, not for a parser
//! (P29). So the relay leaves one small record beside that log: what it is doing
//! now, and what it did about the last refusal.
//!
//! Two halves of one answer, and the split is deliberate:
//!
//! * **the symptom** — `ls_log::newest_refusal`, read by the window itself, so
//!   "Antigravity is hitting the gate right now" is visible whether or not
//!   anything of ours is running. That is exactly the case where the user most
//!   needs to be told something (the bypass is off, or the relay died).
//! * **the answer** — this record, written by the side that knows. The window
//!   never infers "it was intercepted" from a switch being on; it says so only
//!   when the relay wrote down that it did something.
//!
//! Best-effort in both directions. A missing, stale or unparsable record means
//! the window says nothing about the answer, never that there was none.
