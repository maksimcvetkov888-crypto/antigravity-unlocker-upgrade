//! Outbound TCP that leaves through the interface we name, not the one the
//! routing table picks.
//!
//! Every UDP resolver query has been pinned to the ISP link since the first VPN
//! report (`dns_client`, IP_UNICAST_IF, I4). TCP was not, and that half is what
//! a VPN broke (N25): the query left through the ISP link and was substituted,
//! the *connection* to the substituted address followed the routing table into
//! the tunnel, and a provider that serves Russian and Belarusian addresses only
//! refused it from the tunnel's foreign exit. The DoH provider had the same gap
//! (P13): its queries rode the tunnel and came back unsubstituted.
//!
//! IP_UNICAST_IF has to be set *before* `connect`, which `TcpStream` cannot do —
//! it creates and connects in one call — so the socket is built with `socket2`
//! and handed back as an ordinary `TcpStream`.
//!
//! Pinning is only switched on while a tunnel holds the default route. With no
//! tunnel the ISP link *is* the default route, and naming it buys nothing while
//! a wrong guess about which adapter that is (two NICs, a dock) would cost the
//! connection.
