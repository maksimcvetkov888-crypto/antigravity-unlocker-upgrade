// Which CloudCode host the client talks to, and why that is the whole fix.
//
// The region gate lives on the CloudCode API. `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` was
// substituted by the unblock resolvers until they dropped it, and their proxies
// refuse it by SNI, so that host cannot be reached through a permitted region
// any more (kb/dns.md). `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` is the *same
// service* - its 401 names `service: cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` - it is still
// substituted by geohide.ru, and geohide's proxy accepts its SNI. So the fix is
// to send the client at the host that still has a route.
//
// Nothing here patches a binary. Each surface already has a supported way to
// choose the endpoint:
//
// - Desktop passes `--cloud_code_endpoint https://daily-cloudcode-pa...` as a
//   literal in app.asar. Already on the working host; nothing to do.
// - IDE builds the argument from `getCloudCodeUrl()`, which returns
//   `cloudCodeUrlOverride` first if the `jetski.cloudCodeUrl` setting is set,
//   and otherwise the production host for any account without GCP terms - i.e.
//   every ordinary user. That setting is what we write.
// - CLI reads the `CLOUD_CODE_URL` environment variable ("UpdateEndpointURL
//   called with CLOUD_CODE_URL: %q" in agy.exe).
//
// Being configuration rather than a patch matters twice over: an app update
// cannot silently undo it the way it undoes the binary rename (G2), and a
// revert is a key removal rather than a byte-level restore.
