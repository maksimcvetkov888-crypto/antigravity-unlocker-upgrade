// The fallback route: unblock the traffic instead of the name.
//
// The DNS layer can only help with a name some provider still substitutes, and
// it cannot help with how slow that provider's proxy is. `cloudcode-pa` is
// substituted by nobody (S9), and `daily-cloudcode-pa` only by geohide, which
// has been measured taking 1.4-14.8 s over a TLS handshake xbox does in 249 ms
// (P6). So this is a second route, working at the traffic level rather than at
// the name.
//
// It is a loopback CONNECT proxy and nothing else. A gate host goes through the
// authenticated relay in the private `relay` module - a CONNECT tunnel whose TLS
// stays end to end with Google, so no certificate of ours is anywhere near it.
// Everything else, *including* every other `*.googleapis.com`, is a raw byte
// tunnel: sign-in, token refresh and every other program on the machine keep
// exactly the TLS they had before this tool existed.
//
// It used to terminate the client's TLS with a CA generated on this machine and
// carry blocked names in under an SNI the unblock proxies accept - they are
// SNI-whitelisted forwarders (N13), but Google's frontend routes
// `*.googleapis.com` on the HTTP **Host** header, so a carrier SNI reaches the
// right backend. That whole route is gone: the relay reaches the same backends
// with no CA at all, and intercepting the rest black-screened the Desktop app
// with `BadCertificate`. The CA helpers below survive for one purpose - removing
// a certificate an older version installed. Measurements: kb/dns.md.
