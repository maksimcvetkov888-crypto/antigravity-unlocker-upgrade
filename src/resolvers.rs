// Choosing an unblock resolver at query time instead of trusting one forever.
//
// Why this module exists: on 2026-08-24 xbox-dns.ru silently dropped
// `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` from the list of names it substitutes. Measured
// over a raw socket, it answers that name with the genuine Google address
// (172.217.x, TTL 300) while still substituting `generativelanguage` to its
// proxy (87.228.47.204, TTL 60). comss.one and geohide.ru had done the same.
// Nothing in the tool noticed: the relay forwarded, the NRPT rules applied, the
// answer arrived - it was simply not a substituted answer any more.
//
// A single hardcoded resolver cannot detect that, so the relay now asks every
// provider at once and, in parallel, a reference resolver that is known NOT to
// substitute anything. An answer equal to the reference is a passthrough, and
// the next provider is tried; an answer that differs is a real substitution.
// When a provider re-adds a name, or a new provider is added below, it starts
// being used with no code change and no release.

/// How a provider is reached.
///
/// The distinction is not cosmetic: `v4`/`v6` are also what an NRPT rule lists
/// as fallback nameservers (I5, I22), and Windows can only be pointed at a
/// plain resolver. A DoH endpoint answers no UDP query at all, so putting one
/// in a rule would hand a name a nameserver that never replies. That is
/// enforced structurally - a `Doh` provider carries **empty** `v4`/`v6`, so
/// `fallback_v4`, `all_v6` and `substituting_addrs` all skip it without needing
/// to know about transports - and asserted by `a_doh_provider_is_never_offered_
/// as_a_nameserver`.
