//! The switch layer: every capability the window can turn on or off, and the
//! one worker thread that does it.
//!
//! The console build expressed this as numbered menu items, each a script that
//! printed as it went. A switch needs three things a menu item never did: an
//! honest *enable*, an *undo* that is its exact mirror, and a read-only *state*
//! query so the switch can be drawn where the system actually is rather than
//! where the user last left it.
//!
//! ## What is load-bearing here
//!
//! The order of the steps, not the steps. Every sequence below is a documented
//! bug fix and is marked with the invariant it encodes:
//!
//! * **I5** — the relay comes up *before* the NRPT rules, because the rules name
//!   it as the first nameserver.
//! * **I20** — nothing may be re-patching while an unpatch runs, so both
//!   watchdogs stop first and are put back afterwards.
//! * **I39** — the legacy CA comes out *last*, and only once the relay is
//!   current; pulling it from under an old relay kills every gate request.
//! * **I45** — an undo path has no fast exit. Every step runs, each is judged on
//!   its own, failures are collected. `?` between undo steps is the bug.
//! * **I52/I53/I54** — the proxy variable is written only after the legacy pair
//!   is gone, no foreign proxy exists, the rename landed, and something actually
//!   answers on the port.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! One worker, one queue, for everything that touches the system. Not for
//! tidiness: `setup_dns_nrpt` is remove-then-add with no lock, `enable`/`disable`
//! both drive the same image name, and two patch runs race the same files. A
//! second worker would interleave them into a half-installed state.
