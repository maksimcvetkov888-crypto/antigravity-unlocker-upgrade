// untouched, and the revert is byte-exact.
//
// 1. The protobuf field name `ineligible` (and `ineligible_tiers`) becomes a
//    same-length nonsense word. Both the descriptor and the matching Go struct
//    tag are rewritten, so they stay consistent; the JSON the client receives no
//    longer carries the field it gates on. This one is the patch - without it
//    nothing works, so a build where it does not match is a failure.
//
// 2. The environment variable the language server reads its proxy from is
//    renamed to a private name (`PROXY_VAR_*` below). This one is additive: a
//    build where it does not match still unlocks, it just has no local-proxy
//    route, so it is counted and reported, never fatal.
//
// The literals live inside obfstr! blocks so they don't show up as plain
// strings in this binary.

/// server points at it, and the only channel a Go program offers is a proxy
/// variable in its environment. Nothing spawns the server for us - the IDE and
/// the Desktop shell do - so up to `2.11.0_4` the tool wrote `HTTPS_PROXY` into
/// the *user* environment, and every program on the machine that honours it
/// went through `127.0.0.1:53129` as well: shells, git, npm, package managers.
/// That breadth is what D14 accepted as a cost and what the owner rejected on
/// 2026-09-07 ("мешает в системе"). It is also what made a dead listener a
/// machine-wide outage (G20, G31) rather than an Antigravity one.
///
/// **Why a rename is the whole fix.** `golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy` reads
/// `getEnvAny("HTTPS_PROXY", "https_proxy")` - two literals, both present in the
/// binary, and the language server carries a second copy of the pair in its own
/// code. Renaming the **lower-case** one hands this tool a channel that nothing
/// else on the machine reads. Windows environment lookups are case-insensitive
/// (`GetEnvironmentVariable`), so the upper-case literal still answers for either
/// spelling and a user's own `HTTPS_PROXY` keeps working untouched.
///
/// **Measured, not assumed** (`tools/proxyvar_probe.py`, 2026-09-07, LS 1.11.0).
/// The server logs the proxy it dialled per request, so all five runs are read
/// off `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` itself rather than off whichever telemetry
/// client happened to fire first:
///
/// | binary  | variables set              | gate host went via |
/// |---------|----------------------------|--------------------|
/// | stock   | `HTTPS_PROXY`              | that proxy         |
/// | stock   | `AG_LS_PROXY`              | direct - inert     |
/// | patched | `AG_LS_PROXY`              | **ours**           |
/// | patched | `HTTPS_PROXY`              | theirs - unbroken  |
/// | patched | both                       | **ours**           |
///
/// The last row corrects the reasoning this was built on. The order in

/// because the copy that actually resolves the gate client's proxy consults the

/// **precedence** over a proxy the user set. That makes `foreign_proxy` load
/// bearing rather than cosmetic: `reconcile_gate_proxy` and `ensure_proxy_env`
/// must remove ours whenever one of theirs appears, and both do.
