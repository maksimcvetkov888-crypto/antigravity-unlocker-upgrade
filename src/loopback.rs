//! The gate hosts, answered with a loopback address and carried from there.
//!
//! Until 2.14.0_1 the only way the route table ever saw a gate connection was
//! the private proxy variable (`AG_LS_PROXY`, S42) - and an environment
//! variable reaches a process only when it starts. A user who switched the
//! bypass on while Antigravity was open (the ordinary order: patch, launch,
//! then the 400, then this window) had a language server that never asked our
//! proxy for anything, so none of the adaptive part touched their traffic: it
//! dialled Google itself, from wherever the routing table sent it, and the
//! window described a proxy nobody used (G50).
//!
//! DNS reaches a running process on its very next lookup. So while this is up,
//! the relay answers each gate host with an address of its own here, and a
//! connection to it is carried by exactly the route table a `CONNECT` through
//! the proxy variable is: the client's connection never leaves the machine,
//! which also means no VPN can catch it (N25 from the client's side).
//!
//! No TLS is terminated (I27). Each host gets its own loopback address, so the
//! host is known from the address the client dialled and not one byte of its
//! handshake has to be read: the listener hands the socket to the local proxy
//! as a `CONNECT` and splices. The client's TLS goes to Google untouched, and its
//! certificate check is against Google's own certificate.
//!
//! If the listeners cannot be bound - something else holds one of the
//! addresses - the relay simply keeps answering with the substituted addresses
//! it always did.
