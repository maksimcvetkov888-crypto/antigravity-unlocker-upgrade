// A loopback DNS relay, so the answers stay fresh.
//
// Pinning the substituted address into `hosts` works but breaks its own
// contract: xbox-dns answers with **TTL 60**, i.e. it explicitly reserves the
// right to move the address every minute, and a static file holds it forever.
//
// Instead the NRPT rules point at this listener, which relays the query - raw
// bytes, never parsed - to xbox-dns over the ISP link via IP_UNICAST_IF, and
// relays the answer back verbatim. Windows then caches it for exactly the TTL
// the resolver asked for and comes back when it expires, so a rotated address is
// picked up within a minute with no file to go stale. It behaves identically
// with and without a VPN: without one the ISP link is the default path anyway.
//
// Verified before building: the Windows DNS client does send NRPT queries to a
// 127.0.0.0/8 nameserver (a probe rule delivered the question to a listener on
// 127.0.0.53:53).
//
// UDP only, deliberately. Relaying verbatim means a truncated answer would need
// a TCP listener as well, but the routed names answer with a single A record in
// well under 100 bytes, so TC is never set. If that ever changes, Windows falls
// back to the next nameserver in the rule rather than failing outright.

/// Separate from the product version on purpose: the relay is installed once,
/// by an administrator, and then keeps running across reboots from
/// `%ProgramData%` - so a user can be running a months-old relay under a fresh
/// unlocker and never be told. The unlocker compares this against what the
/// installed relay wrote and says so.
///
/// **Bump this whenever the relay's own behaviour changes** - the loop, the
/// resolver logic it carries, the warm loop, the watchdog. A pure UI or patcher
/// change does not need it. Never decrease it: the comparison is "older than",
/// and a version that goes backwards asks every user to reinstall.
///
/// 1 = first versioned relay: answer cache + warm loop.
/// 2 = a non-substituted answer can no longer pin the client for its own TTL.
/// 3 = carries the fallback proxy (`proxy.rs`) alongside the DNS relay.
/// 4 = the proxy no longer answers a socket the client has not spoken on.
/// 5 = identity and telemetry hosts are tunnelled, never intercepted.
/// 6 = liveness is re-probed on the warm loop, so a dead address is dropped
///     within seconds instead of being advertised for ten minutes.
/// 7 = a provider choice is only remembered when it actually substituted.
/// 8 = the race log is client-only, so it stops eating its own log budget.
/// 9 = the warm loop gets a generous liveness budget; the client path stays tight.
/// 10 = `enable()` verifies the relay came up instead of trusting the task.
/// 11 = liveness is measured by the TLS handshake, not just the connection.
/// 12 = the fallback route picks its upstream by measured handshake latency.
/// 13 = the byte pump is non-blocking, so it stops adding its own latency.
/// 14-16 = no separate entries were kept for these.
/// 17 = the proxy carries the gate hosts through the cert-free relay route.
/// 18 = the TLS-terminating carrier route is gone with its CA, and the warm loop
///     no longer measures upstreams (there is one relay, nothing to choose).
/// 19 = idle relayed tunnels are closed before they go stale, the relay is
///     benched when it stops carrying, teardown is logged and lines are stamped.
/// 20 = a relay that cuts tunnels at the handshake counts as failing (bytes
///     moved, so "carried nothing" missed it), and the bench backs off.
/// 21 = the relay leg asks for `cloudcode-pa` instead of `daily-`, which costs
///     it a second proxy hop: 2.14 s median down to 0.22 s, and no variance.
/// 22 = the route is checked by a probe on the warm loop instead of by someone's
///     request, and a burst of in-flight failures no longer lengthens the bench.
/// 23 = every child process it shells out to is bounded, so a hung helper can no
///     longer stop it dead.
/// 27 = routes are ordered by measured speed (`routes`), the client's own log is
///     tailed for the region 400 (`ls_log`) and answered by forcing substitution
///     back on and penalising the route it came through, and the direct route
///     fails inside a budget instead of hanging on the OS connect timeout.
/// 28 = it writes down what it is doing (`gate.json`): the leader route, the
///     forced-substitution deadline, the stand-down verdict, and what it did
///     about the last region 400. Without this generation the window can see
