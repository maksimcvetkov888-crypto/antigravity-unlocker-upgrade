// DNS-over-HTTPS, over a hand-written HTTP/2 client.
//
// Why hand-written. The resolver this exists for answers `505 HTTP Version Not
// Supported` to HTTP/1.1 and offers only `h2` in ALPN - measured on both of its
// addresses. The crate is synchronous and has no HTTP client at all, so the
// alternatives were the `h2` crate (which brings tokio, i.e. an async runtime,
// into a codebase that has none) or the subset of HTTP/2 a DoH exchange
// actually uses. It is a small subset, because one DoH query is one request and
// one response, and a connection carries its queries one after another:
//
// - no multiplexing: one stream at a time per connection, ids 1, 3, 5, ... A
//   connection is kept for the next query (`Pool`), never shared by two at once;
//   a thread that finds none free opens its own.
// - flow control, once: right after the preface the connection-level window is
//   raised to the maximum, so the server never runs out of it however many
//   replies one connection carries. Each stream's own window starts at 65 535,
//   which holds any DNS message, so no per-stream WINDOW_UPDATE is ever needed.
// - no dynamic HPACK table: the request is five headers, and nothing is sent
//   with indexing - on a long connection every unique `?dns=` would otherwise
//   churn the server's table. The *response* headers are never decoded at all,
//   so our decoder's state does not matter. Only DATA frames on the stream
//   being asked are read. The status code is not needed - an error page does
//   not parse as a DNS message, and every caller already handles "no usable
//   reply".
//
// What is deliberately NOT skipped: SETTINGS and PING are acknowledged (a server
// is entitled to drop a connection that ignores them), and GOAWAY/RST_STREAM are
// reported rather than waited out.
//
// Why connections are kept at all: dns-ai.ru measured (2026-09-18) ~195 new
// TCP connections and ~175 DoH handshakes a second per node, 1.06 queries per
// connection, and its CPU going mostly on TLS handshakes. One fresh connection
// per query was the design here, so this client paid for its share of that in
// full.
//
// Pinned to the ISP interface while a tunnel holds the default route, like every
// UDP resolver query (`dns_client::query_raw_via` + IP_UNICAST_IF, I4/N4), so a
// VPN cannot change the geolocation the provider sees. IP_UNICAST_IF has to be
// set *before* connect, which is why the socket comes from `net::connect`
// rather than `TcpStream::connect_timeout` (P13, closed in 2.14.0_1).
